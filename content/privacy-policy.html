<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
	Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be
	processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a
	functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services
	offered there.
</p>
<p>
	Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection
	Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any
	operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
	structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
	disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
	alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
	personal data, whether by automated means or not.
</p>
<p>
	The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the
	type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such
	data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also
	inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our
	website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties
	also processing data they collect and control.
</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<p>
	I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The rights of
	users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data processing
</p>
<h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
<p>
	The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data
	protection law is:
</p>
<p>
	Marvin Schopf<br />
	Mühlstraße 30<br />
	65779 Kelkheim<br />
	Germany
</p>
<p>
	Phone: +49 170 1757-327<br />
	E-Mail: marvin@schopf.biz
</p>
<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
<p>
	With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users
	and data subjects have the right
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
		information about the data being processed, further information about the
		nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15
		GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO),
		or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art.
		17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
	</li>
	<li>
		to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to
		have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20
		GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data
		concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data
		protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
	discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
	processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
	does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
	disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about
	these recipients.
</p>
<p>
	<strong
		>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to
		object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art.
		6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for
		the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong

</p>
<h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
<p>
	Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon
	as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the
	same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise
	stipulated below.
</p>
<h4>Server data</h4>
<p>
	For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us
	or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and
	stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your
	browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the
	webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the
	IP address from which you visited our site.
</p>
<p>
	The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association
	with any other of your data.
</p>
<p>
	The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
	interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of
	our website.
</p>
<p>
	The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued
	storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of
	the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
	relevant incident is finally resolved.
</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
<p>
	We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage
	technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process
	certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data,
	or IP address. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure,
	allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to
	offer a shopping cart function.
</p>
<p>
	The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as
	these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual
	relationships.
</p>
<p>
	If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our
	legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The
	legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
<h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
<p>
	If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we
	cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features
	of our website.
</p>
<p>
	Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the
	legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data
	collected through cookies.
</p>
<h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
<p>
	You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
	Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been
	stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
	browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or
	consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support.
	Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set.
	Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps
	and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using.
	If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
	documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
</p>
<p>
	If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the
	functions on our site may be fully usable.
</p>
<h4>Matomo (formerly: PIWIK)</h4>
<p>
	Our website uses Matomo (formerly: PIWIK). This is open-source software with
	which we can analyze the use of our site. Data such as your IP address, the
	pages you visit, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the duration
	of your visit, and the frequency of your visits is processed.
</p>
<p>
	Matomo stores a cookie on your device via your browser in order to collect
	this data. This cookie is valid for one week.
</p>
<p>
	The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies
	in the analysis and optimization of our website.
</p>
<p>
	We use Matomo with the "Automatically Anonymize Visitor IPs" function. This
	anonymization function truncates your IP address by two bytes so that it is
	impossible to assign it to you or to the internet connection you are using.
</p>
<p>
	If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the
	installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser.
	Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, you have the option of terminating the analysis of your usage
	behavior by opting out. By confirming the link

	analysis. Please note, however, that you must click the above link again if
	you delete the cookies stored on your end device.

<h4>CloudFlare</h4>
<p>
	To secure our website and to optimize loading times, we use the CloudFlare CDN
	(content delivery network). This is a service of Cloudflare Inc., 101 Townsend
	Street, San Francisco, California 94107, USA, hereinafter referred to as
	"CloudFlare".
</p>
<p>
	The legal basis for collecting and processing this information is Art. 6 Para.
	1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the secure operation of our
	website and in its optimization.

	URL);
</p>
<p>- your length of stay on our site; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the frequency with which our pages are accessed.</p>
<p>
	The data is used by CloudFlare for statistical evaluations of the accesses as

<h4>jsdelivr.net-CDN</h4>
<p>
	We use the service jsdeliver.com, a content delivery network ("CDN"), on our
	website to optimise the retrieval speed, the design and presentation of the
	content of our website on different devices.&nbsp; This is an open source
	service provided by Prospectone Sp.z.o.o., ul. Krolweska 65A, 30-081, Cracow,
	Poland.
</p>
<p>
	In order to be able to deliver the content of our website quickly, the service
	uses so-called JavaScript libraries.&nbsp; Corresponding files are loaded from
	a third-party server that records your IP address.&nbsp; We have no influence
	on whether your IP address is processed by third parties for statistical
	purposes.

<p>Prospectone Sp.z.o.o. offers further data protection information.</p>
<p>
	The legal basis is Art.&nbsp; 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest
	lies in speeding up loading times and protecting our website, as well as in
	analysing and optimising our website.
</p>
<p>
	To completely prevent jsdeliver.net from executing the JavaScript code, you
	can install a so-called JavaScript blocker, such as noscript.net or
	ghostery.com. If you were to prevent or restrict the execution of the Java
	Script code, this can mean that for technical reasons not all the content and
	functions of our website may be available.
